How to install on Windows.

OAv2 installation using XAMPP.
------------------------------
1 - Download the Open-AudIT version with XAMPP included, 

2 - Extract to C: drive, 

3 - Run the c:\xampplite\xampp-control.exe, 

4 - Start Apache and MySQL then log on to http://YOURSERVERNAME/.

Done :-)

Don't forget to activate Groups & Reports and to change the password of the Admin & Test users.

OAv2 installation using "source".
---------------------------------
Substitue the correct variable contents when items below are in CAPITALS.

- Download nmap from http://nmap.org/dist/nmap-6.25-setup.exe and install. Ensure Nmap is in your path. This may require logging off and on again (or even a reboot). Check it is in your path by typing "path" (sans quotes) at a command prompt. You should see the Nmap installation directory in the path. For example, I can see C:\Program Files (x86)\Nmap in my path variable.

- Download XAMPPLite from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.7.3/ and install to c:\xampplite. We MUST use 1.7.3 as later versions of XAMPP have broken SNMP support.

- Edit the file c:\xampplite\php\php.ini. Ensure the following extensions are enabled (not commented out with a ;) - php_snmp.dll, php_ldap.dll, php_mcrypt.dll, php_mbstring.dll. Set the following variables: max_execution_time = 600, memory_limit = 512M, error_reporting = E_ALL

- Run c:\xampplite\xampp-control.exe and start the apache and mysql processes. Ensure you can browse to http://YOUR_SERVER. If so, XAMPPLite is installed correctly.

- Download the package and extract the "www" directory to c:\xampplite\htdocs
	zipfile\open-audit\www -> c:\xampplite\htdocs
	You should end up with the c:\xampplite\htdocs directory containing device_images, theme-tango, favicon.ico and index.php items.

- Extract the files in the "open-audit" directory into xampplite
	zipfile\open-audit -> c:\xampplite\open-audit
	You should end up with the c:\xampplite\open-audit directory containing the code_igniter, other, www, readme.txt and agpl-3.0.txt items.

- Check the file c:\xampplite\htdocs\index.php for the $system_path variable. Ensure it is set as below.
	$system_path = "c:/xampplite/open-audit/code_igniter/system";
	Ensure any other reference to $system_path is commented out by putting a hash # at the start of the line.

- Check the file c:\xampplite\htdocs\index.php for the $application_folder variable. Ensure it is set as below.
	$application_folder = "c:/xampplite/open-audit/code_igniter/application";
	Ensure any other reference to $application_folder is commented out by putting a hash # at the start of the line.

- Go to the c:\xampplite\open-audit\other folder and edit the file audit_windows.vbs
	Make sure the variable "url" points to YOUR_SERVER name (if resolvable) or ip address.

- Create the database in Mysql
	cd into the c:\xampp\mysql\bin folder and run the following.
	mysql -u root -e "USE mysql; UPDATE user set Password = password('openauditrootuserpassword') WHERE User = 'root'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
	then run.
	mysql -u root -popenauditrootuserpassword -e "CREATE DATABASE openaudit;"
	then run.
	mysql -u root -popenauditrootuserpassword -e "CREATE USER openaudit@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'openauditpassword';"
	then run.
	mysql -u root -popenauditrootuserpassword -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON openaudit.* TO openaudit@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'openauditpassword';"
	then run.
	mysql -u root -popenauditrootuserpassword -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
	then run.
	mysql -u root -popenauditrootuserpassword openaudit < c:\xampplite\open-audit\other\openaudit_mysql.sql

- Lastly, check the file c:\xampp\open-audit\code_igniter\system\application\config\database.php
	Make sure the credentials are correct to access the database you just created.

- Finally, point your browser at http://YOURSERVER/ and you should be asked to log in. 
	Username: admin
	Password: password

It is installed, congratulations.




Auditing Windows Systems
------------------------

Open a command prompt and enter "cd c:\xampplite\open-audit\other" and then "cscript audit_windows.vbs ."

It should run and post the result to the database. Go back to your web browser and refresh. You should have a group or two created. Go into one of them and click the machine name. You should see the machine details.

To audit your domain, edit the file: c:\xampplite\open-audit\other\audit_domain.vbs

Depending on your system's power, you may wish to ajust the "number_of_audits". I usually use 20. Make sure the "script_name" points to the correct place - 
script_name = "c:\xampplite\open-audit\other\audit_windows.vbs"

Put your domain in the domain_array variable as per the examples.

Run the script with: cscript audit_domain.vbs

You should see your domain PCs start to get audited by seperate audit_windows scripts.

Enjoy !!!
