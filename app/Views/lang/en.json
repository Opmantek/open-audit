We take this and apply a few restrictions, then extract the affected programs and build a SQL query for reporting. Your Open-AudIT instance reaches out to FirstWave and requests any new vulnerabilities on a regular basis. When it receives a new vulnerability record, it is run against the database and the result stored. Each time a device is processed, all matching vulnerabilities are again executed and the result stored. This means when viewing a vulnerability list, we do not need to calculate all affected devices - we already have the result. When you view an individual vulnerability record, we do indeed recalculate the result for this singular vulnerability.<br><br>So, you are always up to date!<br><br>In addition to this, we also calculate the result of all vulnerabilities for all devices daily (usually at a quiet time, say 2am).<br><br>In your instance of Open-AudIT, we allow you to select which vendors you care about. i.e. there is no use retrieving vulnerability records from a vendor whose software you do not use or have installed.

For instance, the CVE record contains a list of affected software - but those software names do not match what we receive when we audit a computer. A good example is Apache. Typically, a CVE record will say the affected software is http_server. In reality, this appears as apache2 (Ubuntu), httpd (Redhat), Apache HTTP Server (Windows) - and others. So, we have to first determine what is the actual name of the program we receive when we ask a computer, and there may be multiple names. After that we must parse the CVE record and create a matching SQL statement. Allowing for multiple program names as above, and multiple versions, version ranges, and even multiple different pieces of software (an example is Thunderbird and Firefox in a single CVE). And your instance of Open-AudIT must take this and apply Orgs filtering as well. And that is just a single CVE. What about determining which CVEs you have and do not have? What about adding a vendor to the list later?

The collector is designed to run discovery upon the network it is situated in. It is not restricted to only that network, but ideally it would essentially be one collector per subnet where required. The collector is driven on a schedule by the server and runs discovery upon the network as specified.<br>When in Stand Alone mode the Collector acts as an independant server, simply forwarding all devices found to the main server.<br><br>Once installed and setup, control of the Collector is performed on the Server (not in Stand Alone mode).<br><br>The only required network ports between the collector and server are 80 or 443 (TCP connection established from the Collector to the Server). The Open-AudIT database is not (and cannot be) shared between these installs.<br><br>By default the collector (not in Stand Alone mode) will request from the server any discovery tasks every 5 minutes (you can configure this on the server for new Collectors using the configuration item collector_check_minutes) therefor any discovery tasks for the collector should be scheduled for 0, 5, 10, 15, etc minutes.",

It depends on the number of IPs to be scanned, the network connection speed, the speed of the devices being scanned, the type of devices being scanned, the number of different credentials being tested and the speed of the Open-AudIT server. We do not have a calculator that would allow us to input those variables and return a value. It is simply too complex. Generally I limit my discoveries to 256 IP addresses - ie, a \/24 subnet. We have had customers scan \/16 subnets (65k addresses) and it does work - but it can take a long time. You are much better off scanning in \/24 blocks.
